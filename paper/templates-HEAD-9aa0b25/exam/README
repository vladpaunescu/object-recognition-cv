Exam Template for SO/SO2/whatever

Use sample.tex for a working example. Command names and comments should be
fairly obvious and no one reads this file anyway.

== Class options

 - uso/so/soa/so2 -- set the course name and logo;

 - twosetsperpage -- print two sets per A4 landscape page, suitable for small
   tests;

 - answerspace -- leave a 2cm space between questions, suitable for short
   answers.

== Caveats

 - twosetsperpage can't tell if the questions are too many for a page and can't
   break pages properly. This especially sucks when using answerspace;

 - the space between questions when using answerspace is hardcoded; just search
   for "2cm" in the class file if you need to change it.

== Some technical (?) details

 - Greatest challenge of all is fitting 6 questions per half A4 page.
   You might have to jump through metaphorical hoops to fit question
   sets with a lot of code.

 - Page looks like crap because of above point. Margins are absurdly small.

 - Enumerate has been redefined to waste less space. Exercise numbers
   are bolded to stand out.

 - Grids and question lists are generated with for loops. Pure
   awesomeness.

 - "Header" (i.e. the logos) looks like crap; we should use a hline to
   separate it from the rest of the text, but that wastes valuable
   space.

 - We use minipages for "two sets per page" cases; do not use footnotes,
   there might be dragons there.
