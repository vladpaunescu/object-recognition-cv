We ahieve both good recognition (classification) rate, and detection rate. However, our system performs well, because we only have one catgory to detect, namely cars. Also, cars appear only from the back position. While initially used for pedestrian detection, HOG proves a very robust method for car detection.

We plan to expand detection for cars photographed from the side.
We also plan to add multiple object categories to the system.
Last but not least, we thing of investingating other classifiers, other than SVMs
