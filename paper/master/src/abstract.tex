We study the question of feature sets for robust visual object
recognition, adopting linear SVM based car detection from rear as a test case. Based on the previous work of Dalal and Triggs (2005) we employ the use of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors, which signficantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We show that the same technique can be applied succesfully in detecting cars. We build a robust system that achievs over 97 \% accuracy in car detection and classification.
